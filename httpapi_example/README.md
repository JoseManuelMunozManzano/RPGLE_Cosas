- MY JSON SERVER - fake online REST server to make tests

  - For GET and PUT
    `http://my-json-server.typicode.com/typicode/demo/posts/1`
  - For POST
    `http://my-json-server.typicode.com/typicode/demo/posts`

  We are not using https because we haven't privileges to use the certificate store.
